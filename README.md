# Users-App

The purpose of this project is to create a simple web application for user management. The App integrates with the backend of the web application that you can find in [this repository](https://github.com/adlopp/users-api).

## Prerequisites 

You only need the API of this [this repository](https://github.com/adlopp/users-api) running.


## How to run

Just execute:

``` bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will open the web application in your browser but you will need to have the API of the application running in order to get the data from the database.

## How to test

You just need to have deployed the API that you can find in [this repository](https://github.com/adlopp/users-api).
